        const pairingDescriptions = {
            'WI': 'The Creative Dreamer - People with this pairing derive real joy and energy from contemplating the world around them and generating a fountain of new ideas. Generally idealistic and future-oriented, they are passionate about new possibilities that break through unnecessary boundaries. They don\'t value practicality, focus or implementation as much as idealism and ingenuity. This sometimes leads to stress or chaos among people around them who might be looking for realism and actionability.',
            'WD': 'The Contemplative Counselor - People with this pairing derive real joy and satisfaction from using their intuition and instincts to evaluate ideas and plans, and to provide others with thoughtful feedback. They tend to be extremely observant and deep in their thinking, and express their insights using impactful words. Because of their proclivity to nuance, they can sometimes be hesitant to declare certainty or express confidence in their own judgments.',
            'WG': 'The Philosophical Motivator - People with this pairing derive real joy and energy from contemplating potential in the world around them, passionately exhorting and encouraging others. They are idealistic and enthusiastic. Their combination leads them to sometimes experience and portray a sense of impulsivity or unpredictability, as they go back and forth between passionate action and cautious reflection.',
            'WE': 'The Idealistic Supporter - People with this pairing derive real joy and energy from providing meaningful support to causes that align with their idealistic values and sense of belonging. They are often modest about their abilities, loyal, and selfless, proving to be extremely valuable, low-maintenance team members. Because of their depth and desire to please others, they can sometimes be overly deferential and often hesitate to initiate change, preferring to let others make the first move.',
            'WT': 'The Careful Implementer - People with this pairing derive real joy and satisfaction from getting things done in a thorough and reliable way, as long as they understand the rationale and importance of what they are doing. They are a mysterious mix of practicality and inquisitiveness, action, and reflection. As a result of the divergence between Wonder and Tenacity, they often find themselves experiencing and projecting angst in the midst of a project, feeling an almost overwhelming need to slow down and ask questions that might alleviate potential problems.',
            'ID': 'The Discriminating Ideator - People with this pairing get real energy and joy from using their intuition and instinctive ability to come up with new ideas from scratch, and they are good at using integrative thinking and pattern recognition rather than data and expertise. As a result, they are particularly effective in solving problems and coming up with workable, practical solutions with a particularly high level of success. They can sometimes appear impatient and over-confident when they receive pushback around their ideas, and they often lose interest after the initial phase of Invention is over.',
            'IG': 'The Evangelizing Innovator - People with this pairing derive real joy and energy from generating new ideas and convincing others of an idea\'s merit. Exuberant and enthusiastic, they are not easily deterred by initial pushback, and enjoy the challenge of sharing ideas to convince others to act. They can be hasty to start selling ideas before taking time to fully consider the prudence of an idea, and can be initially perceived as slightly over-the-top in their approach.',
            'IE': 'The Adaptable Designer - People with this pairing derive real joy and energy from providing new solutions and ideas that serve the unique needs of others. They have the rare ability to balance their passion for ingenuity with the capacity to adjust to the desires of the people they are serving. They are creative, flexible, open to feedback, and easy to work with. In their desire to please others, they are too quick to accommodate and avoid advocating for their own ideas. This can leave them feeling undervalued.',
            'IT': 'The Methodical Architect - People with this pairing get real joy and energy from designing practical solutions to problems that are based on ingenuity, rationale, and precision. They work in a steady and reliable way when generating new ideas, and are not easily distracted by possibilities that might prove logistically unfeasible. In their dogged pursuit of a workable solution, they can sometimes miss the nuance of a given situation or overlook human needs.',
            'DG': 'The Intuitive Activator - People with this pairing get real joy and energy from instinctually evaluating ideas and situations, and quickly identifying the right course of action to take. They generally make quick and surprisingly accurate assessments, often without specific knowledge or data, and artfully rally others to agree with them and their bias for action. Because of their skills and confidence, they can sometimes be cavalier in their declarations and may appear impatient or dismissive when made to consider critical details required for implementation.',
            'DE': 'The Insightful Collaborator - People with this pairing derive real joy and energy from providing others with astute and empathic assistance, based on their intuition and instinct. They are quintessential team players, bringing together exceptional, timely and shrewd counsel, in a selfless manner. They sometimes hesitate to push people to heed their advice, and can be deferential to others when they sense resistance. These tendencies can often leave them feeling underappreciated.',
            'DT': 'The Judicious Accomplisher - People with this pairing derive real joy and energy from getting the right things done efficiently and effectively, and using their judgement to avoid wasting time and resources. They get a lot done by identifying the highest priorities and holding themselves to high standards of execution. They are prudent, focused and diligent. They often feel unnecessary angst about the possibility of failing or when working with others who do not share their high standards in driving for closure.',
            'GE': 'The Enthusiastic Encourager - People with this pairing derive joy and energy from inspiring and supporting others to grow, improve, and feel good about themselves. They are positive, exuberant and optimistic, gladly demonstrating their excitement about the potential of others. They are consummate cheerleaders, in the truest sense of the word. In their desire to be positive, they can sometimes be too quick to affirm others or provide unwarranted praise, leaving them to be potentially dismissed or perceived as naïve or insincere.',
            'GT': 'The Assertive Driver - People with this pairing derive joy and energy from getting things done, as well as rallying others to get things done with them. They don\'t mind blowing through obstacles and are even comfortable ignoring social protocols from time to time when it is required to push something through to completion. They are people of high conviction and standards. Understandably, they can sometimes be seen as pushy, and are often impatient with too much planning and brainstorming, preferring to get right to work.',
            'ET': 'The Loyal Finisher - People with this pairing derive joy and energy from completing tasks and responding to the needs of others in the pursuit of getting things done. They are quick to answer the call to action, equally valuing responsiveness and reliability. They are low-maintenance contributors who hold themselves accountable for delivering on their promises. They have a hard time saying \'no\' to requests and find themselves over-committed and prone to burn-out and lack of appreciation.'
